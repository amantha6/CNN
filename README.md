# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Project

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch. CNNs are a class of deep learning models typically used for image classification, object detection, and other tasks involving visual data.

## What is a CNN?
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network designed to process and recognize patterns in visual data. It is widely used in computer vision tasks such as:

- **Image Classification**
- **Object Detection**
- **Image Segmentation**

CNNs consist of several key layers:

- **Convolutional Layers:** Extract features from the input images using filters.
- **Pooling Layers:** Downsample the feature maps, reducing dimensionality and computation.
- **Fully Connected Layers:** Perform the final classification based on the extracted features.
- **Activation Functions:** Non-linear functions (like ReLU) applied to the outputs of layers.
