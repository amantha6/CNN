# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Project

 ## Introduction
 This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch.
 CNNs are a class of deep learning models typically used for image classification, object detection, 
 and other tasks involving visual data.

# What is a CNN?
 A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network designed to process 
 and recognize patterns in visual data. It is widely used in computer vision tasks such as:

 - Image Classification
 - Object Detection
 - Image Segmentation

# CNNs consist of several key layers:

 - Convolutional Layers: Extract features from the input images using filters.
 - Pooling Layers: Downsample the feature maps, reducing dimensionality and computation.
 - Fully Connected Layers: Perform the final classification based on the extracted features.
 - Activation Functions: Non-linear functions (like ReLU) applied to the outputs of layers.

# Dataset

 The dataset used in this project is:
 - **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits with 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples, 
 each image being a grayscale image of size 28x28 pixels.

 Dataset Preparation:
 The dataset is downloaded using PyTorch's `torchvision.datasets` module.
 Data is preprocessed using transformations such as normalization and conversion to tensor format.
