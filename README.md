# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Project

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch. CNNs are a class of deep learning models typically used for image classification, object detection, and other tasks involving visual data.

## What is a CNN?
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network designed to process and recognize patterns in visual data. It is widely used in computer vision tasks such as:

- **Image Classification**
- **Object Detection**
- **Image Segmentation**

CNNs consist of several key layers:

- **Convolutional Layers:** Extract features from the input images using filters.
- **Pooling Layers:** Downsample the feature maps, reducing dimensionality and computation.
- **Fully Connected Layers:** Perform the final classification based on the extracted features.
- **Activation Functions:** Non-linear functions (like ReLU) applied to the outputs of layers.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is:

- **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits with 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples, each image being a grayscale image of size `28x28` pixels.
  
### Dataset Preparation:
- The dataset is downloaded using PyTorch's `torchvision.datasets` module.
- Data is preprocessed using transformations such as normalization and conversion to tensor format.

## Training

The training process involves the following steps:

1. **Load Data**: The MNIST dataset is loaded using PyTorch's `DataLoader`, and data is split into training and test sets.
2. **Define Model**: The CNN model is defined using the `torch.nn` module, with layers as described above.
3. **Loss Function**: The loss function used is `CrossEntropyLoss`, which is suitable for classification tasks.
4. **Optimizer**: The model is optimized using the `Adam` optimizer, which adapts the learning rate during training.
5. **Training Loop**: For each epoch, the model processes the training data, computes the loss, and updates the model parameters using backpropagation.
6. **Evaluation**: After each epoch, the model is evaluated on the test data, and accuracy is computed.

## Evaluation

The trained CNN model is evaluated on the test dataset using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correctly classified images out of the total number of images in the test set.
- **Loss**: The average loss computed over the test set, indicating how well the model generalizes to unseen data.
